# Introduction-to-Computer-Networks-Final-Project

A final project for the course "Introduction to Computer Networks", implementing socket programming, client–server communication, and basic network protocols.

## Python TCP Chat Room (Modern GUI)

This is a multi-user chat room project based on Python Sockets, featuring a server-side script (`server.py`) and a modern client interface built with **CustomTkinter**.

## Prerequisites

Before running the client application, you **must** install the necessary third-party GUI library. Failing to do so will result in an error.

### 1. Install Required Packages

Please execute the following command in your Terminal or Command Prompt (CMD):

```bash
pip install customtkinter
```

**💡 Tip**: If you encounter a `'pip' is not recognized` error when running the command above, please use the following command instead:

```bash
python -m pip install customtkinter
```
